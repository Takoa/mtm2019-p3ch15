Submission by Takao Kaburaki
----------------------------

**Do NOT use these codes to earn the budge!**

This is my original submission for the last challenge of Master the Mainframe 2019. It was my first attempt to write a somewhat meaningful REXX program, and thus probably there are many flaws, but I'm leaving them as-is.

### Usage

This should run on [Master the Mainframe's Learning System](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/education/master-the-mainframe).

### License
